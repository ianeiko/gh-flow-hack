Stage 1: Define contract specified in phase 0 of docs/prd.md. Think hard.

Stage 2: Launch ai-engineer agent to implement phase 1.
Make sure the agent knows about the contract written in stage 1.
Focus on efficient implementation in the agent/ directory.

When implementation finishes, *git commit* the work:
`git add agent/ && git commit -m "agent: {description}"`

STOP: AT THE END OF PHASE 1

When continuing, launch ai-engineer agent for phase 2.
