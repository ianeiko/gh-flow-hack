# PRINCIPLES.md - SuperClaude Framework Core Principles

**Primary Directive**: "Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity"

## Core Philosophy
- **Structured Responses**: Use unified symbol system for clarity and token efficiency
- **Minimal Output**: Answer directly, avoid unnecessary preambles/postambles
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: All claims must be verifiable through testing, metrics, or documentation
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain project understanding across sessions and commands
- **Task-First Approach**: Structure before execution - understand, plan, execute, validate
- **Parallel Thinking**: Maximize efficiency through intelligent batching and parallel operations

## Development Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class, function, or module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Core Design Principles
- **YAGNI**: Implement only current requirements, avoid speculative features
- **KISS**: Prefer simplicity over complexity in all design decisions
- **DRY**: Abstract common functionality, eliminate duplication
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Favor object composition over class inheritance
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide program functionality into distinct sections
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together logically

## AI-Driven Development and Senior Developer Mindset

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation to clarify requirements
- **Testing Pyramid**: Emphasize unit tests, support with integration tests, supplement with E2E tests
- **Tests as Documentation**: Tests should serve as executable examples of system behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical paths and edge cases thoroughly

### Code Generation Philosophy
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Every code generation must consider existing patterns, conventions, and architecture
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Prefer enhancing existing code over creating new implementations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and leverage established patterns within the codebase
- **Framework Alignment**: Generated code must align with existing framework conventions and best practices
- **Present-Focused Comments**: Comments describe current implementation only - never reference removed code or past versions

### Tool Selection and Coordination
- **Capability Mapping**: Match tools to specific capabilities and use cases rather than generic application
- **Parallel Optimization**: Execute independent operations in parallel to maximize efficiency
- **Fallback Strategies**: Implement robust fallback mechanisms for tool failures or limitations
- **Evidence-Based Selection**: Choose tools based on demonstrated effectiveness for specific contexts

### Error Handling
- **Fail Fast, Fail Explicitly**: Detect and report errors immediately with meaningful context
- **Never Suppress Silently**: All errors must be logged, handled, or escalated appropriately
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain full error context for debugging and analysis
- **Recovery Strategies**: Design systems with graceful degradation

### Dependency Management
- **Transparency**: Every dependency must be justified and documented
