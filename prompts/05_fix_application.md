# Fix Application Standards

## Delegation
**Use `/code-review` plugin to apply fixes from review feedback.**

## Our Standards
- Read review feedback from `docs/coderabbit/{pr_id}.md`
- Apply fixes one by one
- Verify each fix doesn't break existing logic
- Test after all fixes applied
- Follow YAGNI (don't add unrequested features during fixes)
- Update `workflow-state.md` when fixes complete
